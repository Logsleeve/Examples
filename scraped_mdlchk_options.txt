If any layers are missing, Creo ModelCHECK reports them as missing and can add them to the model. If the standard feature type for a layer (as specified in the start configuration file) does not exist in the model, Creo ModelCHECK reports the layer as missing.

If the ModelUPDATE mode is enabled, this check automatically adds missing layers to the model.", "", ""]
